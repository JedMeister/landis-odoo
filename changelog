 * LAPP Appliance massaged into Odoo Appliance
 * Odoo Proxy set to work on ports 80 (redirected to SSL 443) and Odoo Native 8069

  * Changed Turnkey web control panel to use SERVER_NAME
    #  (original change)  displaying correct host when behind proxy (SERVER_ADDR -> HTTP_HOST).
    mofified now in index.php to work properly in this build to create effective Console (default port 12325)
    (HTTP_HOST -> SERVER_NAME)
  
  * significant changes to conf and host file structures
  
  * git clone restricted to --depth-1  (shrinks build significantly)
	should be able to continue with successive pulls but needs to be tested or perhaps reconfigured.
